# preform
The auto resource/endpoint maker for your REST needs.


This program creates resources from database tables, so that you don't have to write code for everything.

As of version now resources are made for [Metamug](https://metamug.com/) and only Postgres Drivers are supported. I'll try to upgrade the script for other frameworks and SQLs as well.
